### Project Title: "Guess the Number Game"
Objective:
Create a simple "Guess the Number" game using Java. This game will involve a user guessing a number generated by the computer within a specified range.

### Requirements:

1. The program should generate a random number between 1 and 100.

2. The user should be prompted to enter a number as their guess.

3. The program should inform the user if their guess is too high, too low, or correct.

4. The game should continue until the user guesses the number correctly or chooses to quit.

5. The program should keep track of the number of attempts made by the user.

6. Implement basic input validation to ensure the user enters a valid number.

 

### Classes to Implement:

1. `GuessingGame`: The main class that handles the game logic and user interaction.

2. `GameRunner`: Contains the `main` method to run the game.
